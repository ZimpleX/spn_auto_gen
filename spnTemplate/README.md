## Description
Automatic generation of Streaming Permutation Network (SPN) in `Verilog` (Supporting arbitrary stride permutation, not limited to matrix transpose). 

SPN consists of three stages: permutation stage, memory stage, permutation stage. It is the *folded* version of CLOS network. Stage 0 and 2 are permutation in space. Stage 1 is permutation in time. 

Control bits for the three stages are generated by `./py_sim/SPN.py`. The output file `./py_sim/auto_gen_SPN_trans.sv` contains the control bitstream which can be directly copied to `./Verilog/unit_test/spn/spn.sv`. 

## Status
Passed RTL simulation of 16x16 matrix transposition on Quartus II.
